# Pods are defined in a special API group, called the core group, which omits the api-group part. 
# For example, StorageClass objects are defined in v1 of the storage.k8s.io API group
# and are described in YAML files as storage.k8s.io/v1.
# However, Pods are in the core API group, which is special,
# beacuse it omits the API group name, so we describe them in YAML files as just v1.
# Note that this is not up to the user, there are objects in various versions of the K8 API
apiVersion: v1
# kind defines the type of pod we want to deploy, this could be Deployment or any controller.

### Some info
In 2019, the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) commissioned a third-party security audit of Kubernetes. There were several findings, including threat modeling, manual code reviews, dynamic penetration testing, and cryptography review. All the findings were given difficulty and severity level. This audit was thorough and conducted in a responsible manner, ensuring all high severity findings were fixed prior to the release of the audit findings.

However, there are still many findings that need help from the community to resolve.

The audit report is also an excellent way to learn more about Kubernetes and how the internals work. Studying reports like this one is a great way to level up after reading this chapter.

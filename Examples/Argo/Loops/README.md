## Loops
---
When writing workflows, it is often very useful to be able to iterate over a set of inputs as shown in this [example](example-wf.yml).

We can also iterate over a set of items like in this [example](example2-wf.yml).

We can pass lists of items as parameters, shown in this [example](example3-wf.yml)

We can even dynamically generate the list of items to iterate over like in this [example](example4-wf.yml)

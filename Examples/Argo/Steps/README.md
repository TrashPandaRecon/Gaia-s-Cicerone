## Multi-Step Workflows, Hello-Hello-Hello
---
In this [example-wf.yml](example), we can see how to create multi-step workflows, how to define more than one template in a workflow spec, and how to create *nested* workflows. This workflow quite simply prints "hello" in three different ways.

The example is pretty self explanatory, to run just use:
```
argo submit example-wf.yml
```

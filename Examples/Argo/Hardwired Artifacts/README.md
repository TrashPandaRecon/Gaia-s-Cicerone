## Hardwired Artifacts
---
Argo lets us use any container image that we want to generate any kind of artifact. In practice, however, we find certain types of artifacts certain types of artifacts are very common, so there is built in support for git, http, gcs and s3 artifacts.

This [example](example-wf.yml) obviously will not work out of the box. It is useful in illustrating what hardwired artifacts are and how they can be used though.

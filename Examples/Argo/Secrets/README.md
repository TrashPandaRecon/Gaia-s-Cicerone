# Secrets
---
Argo supports the same secrets syntax and mechanisms as Kubernetes Pod Specs. (Because it is a CRD)

The [example](example-wf.yml) shows that the syntaxes are quite literally identical. This is because Argo builds on top of Kubernetes. As such the behaviour of Secrets in Argo is the same as the behaviour as the Secrets in Kubernetes.

# Docker Swarm
This is really a pointless example of how to use Docker Swarm, docker's container orchestrator.

One thing to note if you do decide to try this out on your machine is that i set this up for a MacOS environment, the path for docker.sock is probably different
for Windows. So the Visualizer application probably wont work unless you change it to the windows path.

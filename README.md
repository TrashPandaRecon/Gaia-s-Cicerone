## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project attempts to give the user knowledge about the architecture and technologies used in building cloud native applications. The end goal is not complete fluency in everything mentioned. Instead, it is to give the user enough base knowledge to seek answers for themselves and understand the design patterns and terminology used.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

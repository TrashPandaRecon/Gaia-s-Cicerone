## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project attempts to give the user knowledge about the architecture and technologies used in building cloud native applications. The end goal is not complete fluency in everything mentioned. Instead, it is to give the user enough base knowledge to seek answers for themselves and understand the design patterns and terminology used.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The bare minimum is to have a docker installed.

The ideal is to install everything mentioned in the guide.

A list of the overarching technologies used.
Docker
Kubernetes
Argo
Kafka
Whatever database you want 

Note: It is ideal for you to use a POSIX system - MacOS/Linux Distros. This is because the vast majority of the guide will be referring to things specific to the Linux Kernel.

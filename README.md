# SDE Project
Current list of things to look into:
1. Docker - Containers
2. Kubernetes(K8) - Container orchestration
3. Argo - Workflow Orchestration built on top of K8
4. Kafka - Event streaming 
5. Various databases Mongodb, Cassandra, Redis, Postgresql (due to it being a hybrid recently)
6. Elastic search and its viability to be used outside its intention as a datastore for text
7. Other add ons if there is time, heartbeat servers security frameworks etc etc

Priorty in terms of importance:
Docker > Kubernetes > Kafka > DBs > Argo > everything else
